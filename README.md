# Working with Quantum Natural Gradient 

### Intro to the Repo
Welcome to the repo feauturing all-things QNG x VQE! All contributions to this repo were made during the Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF) Mentorship Program (you can check them out at: http://qosf.org !) 

The purpose of this repo was to experiment with the new quantum natural gradient descent opimization method for VQEs, as proposed in Stokes et al. (2019), and compare its perfomance with the vanilla (original) gradient descent method.

Our findings were that in evey case the Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method would always out-best the vanilla gradient descent method. To understand why, check out these two articles written by QOSF mentees Maggie and Lana, for an in-depth and intuitive explanation of the algorithm:
